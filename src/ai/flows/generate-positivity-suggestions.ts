A user's recent chat history shows the following sentiment breakdown:
- Positive Messages: {{{positive}}}
- Negative Messages: {{{negative}}}
- Neutral Messages: {{{neutral}}}

Their Losada Ratio (Positive/Negative) is low, suggesting they might be in a "languishing" state.

Your task is to provide 2-3 brief, actionable, and encouraging suggestions to help them cultivate a more positive mindset. Frame your response as "Here are a couple of ideas to try:".
Format the output in Markdown.

Focus on simple, evidence-based techniques like:
- Gratitude practice (e.g., "Take a moment to think of one small thing that went well today.")
- Mindful observation (e.g., "Notice the details of your next mealâ€”the colors, the smells, the textures.")
- Self-compassion (e.g., "It's okay to feel this way. Treat yourself with the same kindness you'd offer a friend.")
- A small act of kindness.

Keep the suggestions encouraging and not demanding. Do not mention the Losada Ratio or the word "languishing" to the user.`,
